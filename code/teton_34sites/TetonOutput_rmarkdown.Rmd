#### Continental Stream Productivity Modeling

The following document walks through the initial results of applying the Ricker primary productivity model developed by Blaszczak et al. to stream sites across the continental United States.

If you would like to be added to the GitHub repository that currently houses the below code, please contact Heili at hlowman *at* unr.edu. Everyone is welcome to join the repo as a collaborator!

Data was combined from the following sources:

- x
- y
- z

We then applied the following rules to filter the available data:

- x
- y
- z

From the initial 356 river sites, there remains 34 sites and 140 site-years of data.

```{r map, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Fig. 1. Summary statistics and a map of the United States with locations of all stream sites included in final dataset fit to Ricker model.", echo = FALSE}

# insert UPDATED site map + histograms with available data here
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "full_fig2.png"))

```

Figures of all available covariates (by site-year) as well as the full set of model diagnostics are available at this shiny app address - INSERT SHINY HTML LINK HERE.

However, for today's meeting, I have assembled a few overview figures examining initial relationships between model parameter values and stream order.

Fig 3 - k vs r

Fig 4 - rk vs cs

Fig 5 - r vs order

Fig 6 - k vs order

#### Next Steps

We intend to re-fit the model parsing out each site year, so that we may also investigate temporal trends.

#### Questions for You:

(1) What should the longest permissible gap in data be? It is currently set to 14 days.

(2) Should we explore the feasibility of estimating missing data? Or do you imagine reviewers might respond poorly to estimated values used to fit the model (a sort-of dual-layered estimation), even if model fit is improved by the estimation of missing data?

(3) What is the value of fitting the model to full time-series (e.g., if there are 7 years of data available at a given site) compared to fitting the model to singular site years (e.g., performing the temporal comparisons mentioned in the next steps)?
