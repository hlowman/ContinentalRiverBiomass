#### Continental Stream Productivity Modeling

The following document walks through the initial results of applying the Ricker primary productivity model initially developed by Blaszczak et al. to stream sites across the continental United States.

*Note: If you would like to be added to the GitHub repository that currently houses the below code, please contact Heili at hlowman at unr.edu. Everyone is welcome to join the repo as a collaborator!*

Data was combined from the following sources:

- Site information, model diagnostics, and time series data were from [Appling et al., 2018](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59bff507e4b091459a5e0982).
- Additional information regarding stream order was from [Blaszczak et al., 2021](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/606f60afd34ef99870188ee5).
- Stream light data were from [Savoy and Harvey, 2021](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f974adfd34e198cb77db168).

We then applied the following rules to filter the available data:

- Filtered for high-quality sites based on model diagnostics (e.g., K600 sigma Rhat < 1.05).
- Removed sites with certain flags (e.g., structural dam flag = 95).
- Filtered for sites that have a maximum time gap of 14 days and a minimum of 275 days per year of GPP data.
- For any GPP values below zero, they were assigned a value between 0.05 and 0.13.
- For sites that did not have stream light data available from Savoy and Harvey, 2021, light values were set to surface PAR.

From the initial 356 river sites in the Appling dataset, our filtered dataset consists of **34 sites** and **135 site-years** of data.

```{r fig1, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Fig. 1. Summary statistics of (A) stream order and (B) years of data above (C) a map of the United States with locations of all stream sites included in the dataset.", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "teton_34sites", "map_fig_34sites.png"))

```

Figures of all available covariates (by site-year) as well as the full set of our model diagnostics are available to view on a separate R Shiny application located [here](https://hlowman.shinyapps.io/shiny/). Below are a few overview figures examining initial relationships among model parameter values and between parameters and stream order.

```{r fig2, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Fig. 2. Boxplots of (A) mean maximum growth rates (r) and (B) mean carrying capacities (K) for individual sites grouped by stream order as well as (C) mean maximum growth rates plotted against mean carrying capacities.", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "teton_34sites", "r_k_paneled.jpg"))

```


```{r fig3, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Fig. 3. Boxplots of (A) mean steepness of persistence curves (s) and (B) mean critical discharge (c) for individual sites grouped by stream order as well as (C) mean steepness of persistence curves plotted against mean critical discharges.", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "teton_34sites", "s_c_paneled.jpg"))

```

```{r fig4, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Fig. 4. Productivity-related parameters (r, K) plotted against disturbance-related parameters (c, s).", out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "teton_34sites", "rk_vs_cs.jpg"))

```

*Next Steps:* Following this meeting, we intend to re-fit the model parsing out each site year, so that we may also investigate temporal trends.

#### Questions for You:

(1) What should the longest permissible gap in data be? It is currently set to 14 days.

(a) Should we also set a rule regarding year-long gaps? Currently, we have datasets that skip entire years.

(2) Should we explore the feasibility of estimating missing data? Or do you imagine reviewers might respond poorly to estimated values used to fit the model (a sort-of dual-layered estimation), even if model fit is improved by the estimation of missing data?

(3) What is the value of fitting the model to full time-series (e.g., if there are 7 years of data available at a given site) compared to fitting the model to singular site years (e.g., performing the temporal comparisons mentioned in the next steps)?
